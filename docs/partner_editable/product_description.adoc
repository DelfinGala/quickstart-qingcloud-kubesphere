KubeSphere is a multitenant, enterprise-grade, container platform with full-stack automation, operation, and DevOps workflows. It provides developer-friendly web interfaces, which can help enterprises build more robust and feature-rich platforms, which includes the most common functionality needed for enterprise Kubernetes strategies.

This Quick Start is powered by AWS CloudFormation templates that help end users automatically provision Amazon EKS environments on a new or existing VPC. This gives end users the ability to manage Amazon EKS clusters through the KubeSphere console, which provides the following capabilities:

* Kubernetes resource management
* Multicloud and multicluster management
* DevOps (CI/CD based on https://www.jenkins.io/[Jenkins])
* Application lifecycle management
* App store
* Rich observability: monitoring, logging, auditing, alerting, and notifying
* Service mesh for distributed microservices (based on https://istio.io/[Istio] and https://www.jaegertracing.io/[Jaeger])
* Enterprise multitenancy
* Storage and networking management
* Automatic scaling
* Role-based access control
* https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/[Network Policies]
